The code (PandasBiogeme) will generate one file here, 'persons_from_SynPop_with_probability_home_office.csv'.
This file contains the results of the calibration of the constant against the synthetic population.
It is the final result of several simulations using the choice model on the synthetic population, using every time an
updated alternative specific constant, so that the predicted ratio of people working from home in the synthetic
population corresponds to the observed ratio of people working from home in the Mobility and Transport Microcensus.
It is similar to the original file 'persons_from_SynPop2017.csv' in the folder
'data/output/data/validation_with_SynPop/', but it has two new columns, 'Prob. home office' and 'Prob. no home office',
containing the probability of doing home office.
The file is generated by the function 'calibrate_the_constant_by_simulating_on_synthetic_population' in the file
'calibrate_the_constant.py'.
