The code (PandasBiogeme) will generate one file here, 'persons_with_probability_home_office.csv'.
This file contains the results of the calibration of the constant against the Mobility and Transport Microcensus (MTMC).
It is the final result of several simulations using the choice model on the full sample of the MTMC, using every time an
updated alternative specific constant, so that the predicted ratio of people working from home in the MTMC corresponds
to the observed ratio of people working from home in the MTMC.
It is similar to the original file 'persons.csv' in the folder 'data/output/data/estimation/', but it has two new
columns, 'Prob. home office' and 'Prob. no home office', containing the probability of doing home office.
The file is generated by the function 'calibrate_the_constant_by_simulating_on_microcensus' in the file
'calibrate_the_constant.py'.
