The code (PandasBiogeme) will generate one file here, 'persons_from_SynPop_with_probability_home_office.csv'.
This file contains the results of the simulation using the choice model on the synthetic population 2040.
It is similar to the original file 'persons_from_SynPop2040.csv' in the folder 'data/output/data/application_to_SynPop_2040/',
but it has two new columns, 'Prob. home office' and 'Prob. no home office', containing the probability of working from home.
