The code (PandasBiogeme) will generate three files here:
- 'logit_telecommuting.html';
- 'logit_telecommuting.pickle'; and
- 'logit_telecommuting.tex'.
These files contain the results of the estimation of the choice model using the MTMC data of 2015 and 2020 together.
The HTML file contains results that can be read by humans (using a browser);
The pickle file is a binary file of the results of the estimation, that can be used in another Python script.
The .tex file contains the results in LaTeX format.
