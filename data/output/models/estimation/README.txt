The code (PandasBiogeme) will generate three files here:
- 'logit_home_office.html';
- 'logit_home_office.pickle'; and
- 'logit_home_office.tex'.
These files contain the results of the estimation of the choice model.
The HTML file contains results that can be read by humans (using a browser);
The pickle file is a binary file of the results of the estimation, that can be used in another Python script.
The .tex file contains the results in LaTeX format.
