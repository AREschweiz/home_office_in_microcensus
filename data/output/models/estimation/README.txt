The code (PandasBiogeme) will generate two files here: 'logit_home_office.html' and 'logit_home_office.pickle'.
These files contain the results of the estimation of the choice model.
The HTML file contains results that can be read by humans (using a browser), while the pickle file is a binary file of the results of the estimation, that can be used in another Python script.
