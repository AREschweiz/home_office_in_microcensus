The code (PandasBiogeme) will generate one file here, 'persons_from_SynPop_with_probability_home_office.csv'.
This file contains the results of the simulation using the choice model on the synthetic population (external validation).
It is similar to the original file 'persons_from_SynPop2017.csv' in the folder 'data/output/data/validation_with_SynPop/',
but it has two new columns, 'Prob. home office' and 'Prob. no home office', containing the probability of doing home office.
