The code (PandasBiogeme) will generate two files here: 'logit_home_office_80.html' and 'logit_home_office_80.pickle'.
These files contain the results of the estimation of the choice model on 80% of the data (internal cross validation).
The HTML file contains results that can be read by humans (using a browser).
The pickle file is a binary file of the results of the estimation, that is used in the Python script for the simulation part of the internal validation.
