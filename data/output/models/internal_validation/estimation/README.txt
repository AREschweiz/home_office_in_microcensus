The code (PandasBiogeme) will generate two files here: 'logit_home_office.html' and 'logit_home_office.pickle'.
These files contain the results of the estimation of the choice model on 80% of the data (internal cross validation).
The HTML file contains results that can be read by humans (using a browser), while the pickle file is a binary file of the results of the estimation, that is used in the Python script for the simulation part of the internal validation.
